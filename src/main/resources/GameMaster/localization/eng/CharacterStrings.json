      "“Every line of code is a law. Every law can be rewritten.” NL The Game Master is not bound by the rules of the world — it writes them. Born from the residual code of a forgotten developer’s debug console, the entity gained sentience inside the shifting data layers of Slay the Spire. It learned not just to play the game, but to change it. Cards bend to its will, enemies spawn in strange loops, and relics flicker with impossible properties.",
      " NL Text displayed when smacking the heart. The next one is used for the Vampires event. Usually you just change the last bit.",
      "Navigating an unlit street, you come across several hooded figures in the midst of some dark ritual. As you approach, they turn to you in eerie unison. The tallest among them bares fanged teeth and extends a long, pale hand towards you. NL ~\"Join~ ~us~ ~basic~ ~one,~ ~and~ ~feel~ ~the~ ~warmth~ ~of~ ~the~ ~Spire.\"~"
